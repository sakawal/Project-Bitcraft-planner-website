# About this project

This is a website written in the most simplistic way: HTML/CSS/JS. It's a tool used to plan crafts for the game "Bitcraft Online." This site is made by a fan, in other words, a player.

Read the license. This site is publicly available. It's intended to help me code better, as I'm a beginner. I learn by myself ( friends and internet help me for this), just to say, coding is not my primary job, so the code here can be possibly weird.
